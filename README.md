# python-challenge

In this python challenge, I had to loop through two difference CSV files.

In the PyBank folder, I looped through a CSV file to determine the average monthly revenue using Python. 
In the same python file, I identified which months had the highest profit increase and which month had the largest loss in revenue.

In the PyPoll folder, I looped through 3,521,001 data entry points to determine which candidate won an election.
I also returned each candidates total vote count, and percentage of overall votes.
